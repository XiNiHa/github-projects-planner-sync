# GitHub Projects - Planner Sync

I realized that the Planner part of Microsoft Graph API doesn't allow Apps to use the API without user interaction,
and that means the sync automation can't be implemented without any kind of hacky tricks.

Since I'm not interested in engineering that kind of stuff for this somewhat simple task, I'm giving up working on this project.
